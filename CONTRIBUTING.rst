Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `tsgettoolbox` for local development.

1. Fork the `tsgettoolbox` repo on bitbucket.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:your_github_login/tsgettoolbox.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv tsgettoolbox
    $ cd tsgettoolbox/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. For testing you also need to install tox, coverage, and flake8::

    $ pip install tox
    $ pip install coverage
    $ pip install flake8

5. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

Now you can make your changes locally.

6. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ tox

Bring the htmlcov/index.html file up into a browser to make sure that the code has appropriate test coverage.

7. Commit your changes and push your branch to bitbucket::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

8. Submit a pull request through the bitbucket website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7, and 3.3.
